Hi, I'm Patrick.

I'm a software engineer in San Francisco working at [Asana](https://asana.com). I previously worked at
Google and Lexity. I studied CS and Mathematics at Stanford. This blog is a place for me to post
about whatever technical or mathematical topics I get interested in or want to share.
